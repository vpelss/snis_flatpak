# 
# this file defines factions
#
# format is:
#
# faction_name
# x y z
# faction_name
# x y z
# faction_name
# x y z
# 
# where x, y and z are integers that indicate the center of the factions
# sphere of influence.  When ships are randomly added to the system, they
# take on the faction whose center is closest to their position.
#
# After the factions and spheres of influence are listed, the faction hostility
# matrix may be modified.  Default hostility between factions is 3 (very low).
#
# To modify, add lines such as
# faction_name_1 faction_name_2 hostility_value
# hostility values are between 0 and 100.
# e.g:
#
# hostility Wallunni Zarkon 50
